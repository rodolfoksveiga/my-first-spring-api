# My first Spring Boot API

### Deployed application: https://my-first-spring-api-rv.herokuapp.com/

#### This is my first Spring Boot project, where I used Java 15 to develop a RESTful API. The API feeds a PostgreSQL database with useful information regarding students of a fictitius institution.

Throghout this project I could apply the four basic concepts of backend software development (CRUD):
* **Create**;
* **Read**;
* **Update**;
* **Delete**.

Some URL examples:
* GET https://my-first-spring-api-rv.herokuapp.com/api/v1/student/
  * Returns a JSON file containing a list of students.
